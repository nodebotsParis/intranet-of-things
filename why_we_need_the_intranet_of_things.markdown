### I'm gorhgorh on the interweb

what I mostly do:

- cat toys
- installation for museum
- crazy conferences (squatconf, nodebots day, nodeschool)
- nodebots workshops !

___
and I do that with :

- the Electrolab
- Nodebots of Paris / London / everywhere

contact: @gorhgorh, @lesNodebots
___

So I'm an old chap that was there in the netscape era, I took part in the settlement of our current messy situation about the internet.

I started young, filled with the idea that the internet would break the boundaries of this world, an open web for open people ... free, shared  knowledge and all

I was not totally wrong in the end. theses things happened, amongst other things ... but I saw the irony of fighting for a free web that i helped to enslave at some points

# Privacy matters ?

questions :
how many of you :

- are concerned by their online privacy
- are using protected emails (PGP, private mail server, etc)
- are using plugin to avoid tracking in their daily life (DNT, duck duck go, etc etc)
- are using VPN, TOR ...

Today, there are almost no online services (at least the one that are really needed) that does not offer a bargain with hight stakes a Faustian dilemma, my service against your data.

This model worked perfectly (depending on the side you are in) for a few years, then these bloody anarch / hippies / Cypherpunk came, bragging that we need an open web, offering tools and service with a lighter price to pay.

And you started to have friends asking you way to have more privacy, secure email and such.

This is a good thing ...

but what about privacy in your own home ... ?

# Do IOTs dreams of Big brother ?

# NO

# but humans do ...

IOT are like the internet, TOOLS, as such they are not inherently evil ... unless you ask them to ...

# Privacy still exists only because of lacking tools
(pict of a screw driver and a safe)

--
This concern about privacy in our online life is now important to lots of people and alternative to websites that predate you privacy exists (diaspora, ello), theses tools started because corporation / governments now have the fire power to use this data.
___

# Will we buy these tools for them ?

--
We are just at the beginning of the IOT erra, a period a bit like when myspace we cool on the interweb.

connected house, quantified self, toy to play with your pets, monitor your children activity, etc ... ,  are slowly but steadily invading our world and more and more are kickstarted / developed everyday.

Most of these project are potential Trojan horses ...

And we buy them willingly, and accept almost no control on the data it provides ...

___
# So ... should we go back to the "candle" era ?
___
# NO
___
#but we should be aware of that
### A.K.A history repeating

--
I'm not saying Iot are evil, they are,mainly a good thing because can provide interesting information about your surrounding environment.

Pertinent information ... you know the thing that have a HUGE value for gov/ companies ... could that be valuable/moneytised ?

Anyone see a recurring pattern here ?

# "smart electric meter" example
___
#Pros

- pay a smaller electric bill
- remote control (pre heat your secondary home before going there)
- help you finding heat leaks
- avoid morning meeting with the E.D.F guys (unless you did not pay ^^^)

--
We all know how that we need to reduce our power consumption, and theses are a great tool to start with.

Heating optimisation, launch the washing machine at the low price rate hours, there are lots of uses for such systems, and who would refuse to pay smaller bill ?

___
# Cons

- ultimate tracking device
- open to hacks

--
to be really efficient, these systems require sensors in the house and monitor not only the main electric system but each nodes. with these information, we can easily define when did you get home, and how many people took showers, did you eat or not ... scary, isn't it ?

Wait, there is more ... most of theses systems are using simple http to communicate with the server because you know, nobody would try to hack houses, right ?

# WTF Jawbone Up ??? <br> (or B.A.N* and IOTs )

'*' Body Area Network

--
this talk idea started when ... I wanted to loose weight so I got me a Jawbone Up, a device to track my body activity (step per day and sleeping pattern). It is a really simple device with a motion sensor, a vibrator, a chip to treat / send data and a jack to acquire data via my cellphone.

I loved it a lot, and loose weight faster that without it, so It made it job but it is providing ZERO control over the data it gathered.

# get data out of the thing
(pict of the BAN, PAN, LAN, internet)

--
to understand this example better, here is a map of a standard network mesh in homes

1. the B.A.N is composed of wearable devices, wrist bands, watches, glasses etc etc it kind of include you phone as well
2. P.A.N (personal area network) are the devices connected to your home's network, it is composed of computers, tablets, non wearable iots, domotic systems
3. Internet is everything that is BEFORE your internet connection (DNS server etc etc)

here is the current workflow to get data out of my band

1. connect it to my cellphone via the jack (data is an encrypted audio file sampled via my earphone jack)
2. send this data over the internet via wifi
3. data is treated and stored in Jawbone server (anonymously, so they say)
4. data is sent back to my phone via wifi

let's pretend that my phone can't handle the decryption of the said data, computers in my PAN could do that, but there is no option whatsoever to do so ...

# Problems, problems, what about solutions ?
___
# A) Choose your toys wisely

--
for every types of IOT devices there are some more open than others, Fitbit for example provide an offline app to interact with your sensors.

IOT are physical product, once produced they need to be sold, so companies will listen to consumers if we don't buy devices that don't give up prime access to the data since they are less resilient than online service at launch.

___
# B) Build an intranet of thing

--
I see the intranet of things like the offline first movement, a way to treat your data in a sane way, where you can choose if this data is accessible online or not.

Behind the buzzword, it just mean use of develop devices that only need local connection to interact with it's surrounding. Let's see how we can do that.

I don't need backups, NSA works flawlessly for that.

As some of you here, I worked on creating the web as we know it now, we all make errors, don't we ?



## History repeating
(picture of spanish bringing "presents"" agains gold)

___
You may know the concept of Cyclic history, it already had proven to be a solid theory, and almost no one contest it for now.

But there is a new parameter in this theory, Cycles are faster an faster.

## Privacy still exists only because of lacking tools

(hammer drill pict)

___
I know this look in your eyes, your are part of the web you ALREADY know that there is no privacy on the interweb, and for those old enough you are happy to have spend your childhood BEFORE the Facebook era.

when you first started to realise what was happening, it was OBVIOUS that the only thing preventing gov/trusts to gather and play with these data was ... the lack of power.

You want to know why they don't know what is happening in your bathroom ?

The lack of sensors ...

## Their plan

(insert big brother pict)

___
#SAME OLD SHIT
## IT WORKED ONCE, IT WILL AGAIN.

- provide service that make your life easier
- money support to buy intrusive devices
- don't provide open api to interact with the devices

___

As crazy as it sounds, their first attack is exactly the same that Facebook/google used, providing easy to use service, against your data, for "free"...

Still a few things are different in these model.

___

- not "free"
- require infrastructures (production/stock/shops)
- legal bonding to the country where it is sold

___

## not free
